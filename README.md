Prosthetic-Arm-Initiative

Kansas State University Senior Design II Project, Electromechanical 3D Printed Prosthetic Arm Initiative SPRING 2023

Due to the extortionate price of mechanical prosthetic arms, Dr. B at Kansas State University has started an initiative to design, build, and protype an open source arm.

The main deliverables for SPRING 2023 were as follows:

1. A complete model of the hand and forearm in SolidWorks.  
2. A complete set of STL files for printing the hand and arm.
3. An assembled prototype of the hand and arm.
4. A supporting controller that allows the hand to be opened and closed.  
5. Implementation of a feedback mechanism that allows the hand to grip both an egg without crushing it and a cue ball without dropping it.
6. Documentation for future development.



In this repository are two arms and their respective supporting documention, designed by two seperate groups (denoted as KSU 1 and KSU 2) that seek to achieve these goal

KSU 1 is comprised of:

Julien Illo, Sam Boselli, Talon Hanssen, Paige Durand, Jonathan Perez, Michael Arnold 

KSU 2 is comprised of:

Christopher Xu, Randen Plattner, Juan Ponce, Aydan Vanmeerhaeghe, Logan Senecal, Vance Weber
